# Lecture-Notes
Lecture notes from courses I am attending.

Please do not trust them blindly. I have most probably missed a lot of typos.

If you want to type your course notes in latex as well, I am following the setup at https://github.com/sleepymalc/VSCode-LaTeX-Inkscape.

Please let me know if you find any typos.
